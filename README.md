## Goal
Hooked & Wired is a fullstack app designed to help people who are trying to break vices. Users will be able to log in and sign up using their emails or their Facebook information. The app has three main functions: 1. The Vice Tracker (a streak calendar to track one or multiple vices), 2. Rewards tool (where people can customize what kind of reward they'd like to give themselves and when), and 3. a Reinforcement tool (if users are substituting a vice for exercise, the app will use a maps API to track/log the distance. This tool will also return how much money the user has saved during their streak - once they log how much money their habit costs them on a weekly basis). 

## How it's made
Made using CSS, Javascript, Node.js, APIs, JSON, Express, EJS, MongoDB, and User Authentification using passport.


## Notes
This app will be ready to launch in December. Right now, I just have the barebones of it, but will update it as I go.
