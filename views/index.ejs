        <h2 id="why">The Story Behind The App</h2>
        <p id="whyPara">
            Growing up in NYC was tough. I saw vices take people I love either farther away from themselves, 
            or worse - it stole their life. I grew up witnessing the effects that trauma and disenfranchisement 
            had on a person’s soul, and I saw how much of a spiritual battle my community was under. Kids had 
            to grow up quick, and too often that led people to 
            bad habits.  <br><br>
            <span id="created">I created this app because I think that the 
            relationship we have with ourselves is both hard work and heart work. 
            The redemptive love we can hold for ourselves can free us from the systematic 
            battles we face. No matter the scale, seriousness, or impact of a bad 
            habit - everyone deserves a chance at getting rewired and realigned with 
            themselves.</span>
